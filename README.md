## Tables:

* [Table 1. Data providers](https://github.com/madi/FOSS4G2023_Prizren_Kosovo/blob/main/Table1_Data_Providers.md): they make EO datasets available within
    infrastructures;

* [Table 2. Cloud-based geoprocessing platforms](https://github.com/madi/FOSS4G2023_Prizren_Kosovo/blob/main/Table2_Cloud-based_geo-processing_platforms.md): they offer computational capacity in line with the paradigm “bring the user to the data”;

* [Table 3. Brokers and catalogues](https://github.com/madi/FOSS4G2023_Prizren_Kosovo/blob/main/Table3_Brokers_and_catalogues.md): they offer discovery services by harvesting data from existing catalogues;

* [Table 4. Thematic hubs and Research infrastructures](https://github.com/madi/FOSS4G2023_Prizren_Kosovo/blob/main/Table4_Thematic_hubs_and_Research_infrastructures.md): they incorporate EO data relevant to specific thematic domains, such as agriculture, biodiversity and atmosphere;

* [Table 5. Data cubes](https://github.com/madi/FOSS4G2023_Prizren_Kosovo/blob/main/Table5_Data_cubes.md): they implement a multidimensional array structure, on which one can load several bands and perform slicing and algebraic operations;

* [Table 6. Virtual infrastructures](https://github.com/madi/FOSS4G2023_Prizren_Kosovo/blob/main/Table6_Virtual_infrastructures.md): they place additional layers on top of existing platforms with the goal to facilitate data access and increase the discoverability of and interoperability between such platforms;

* [Table 7. Initiatives and programmes](): EO-related, publicly funded programmes.
